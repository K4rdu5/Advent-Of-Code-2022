# Advent-Of-Code-2022

Finally the wait is over lets try and solve some puzzles shall we?

Not sure how many I will manage to complete this year but I'm hopeful that I will be able to implement some new tricks I've acquired this year.

For solving im going to try and do the most optimal coding but my first priority is actually getting the challenges done rather than them being pretty, this is something that I'll come back to later to optimize my coding.

Happy coding and good luck if you're taking on some challenges aswell.
